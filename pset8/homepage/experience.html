                        <p>I am currently undertaking the DE&S engineering graduate scheme, consisting of a series of placements and development opportunities aimed at giving me experience across the entire engineering life cycle and building my portfolio of evidence for chartership.</p>
                        <p>My first placement was in the Puma 2 delivery team, providing In-Service support for the mechanical and propulsion sides of the platform. This role has introduced me to the processes involved in maintaining airworthiness in a military environment while improving my engineering knowledge and written communication skills through the drafting of a range of technical instructions.</p>
                        <p>In February 2020 I joined GKN Aerospace to gain experience of aerospace manufacturing and automation.</p>

                        <p>This role was in the Product Support team for the GP7000, one of the propulsion options for the Airbus A380. I acted as a technical communication line between our maintenance facility and the design and life cycle engineers located worldwide.</p>
                        <p>The part condition feedback I provided was used to implement changes to inspection limits, introduce new repairs and determine root cause of engine component failure. I also took the opportunity to identify my own opportunities for part repairs and work to have these introduced to reduce component rejection. This daily exposure to the hardware was great for building my knowledge of aircraft propulsion systems and the maintenance, repair and overhaul processes they undergo. I also gained a greater appreciation of how the commercial aircraft industry and a large company such as GE operates.</p>
                        <p>Outside of the office, my fellow interns and I managed a team of students for the Engineering Education Scheme Wales, setting them an industrial challenge and providing support as they worked to solve it. I also tutored local school children GCSE Maths on a weekly basis as a representative of GE.</p>
